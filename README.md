# Cyber Security Threats

This repository explores global cyber security threats through interactive data storytelling. Using Python's data science and visualization libraries, the project breaks down complex datasets into clear, compelling insights that highlight the evolving landscape of cyber attacks worldwide.

## 📁 Contents

- **`Data_Storytelling_Cyber_Security_Threats.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creates interactive visualizations. It includes:
  - Import and cleaning of threat data
  - Visual comparisons of attack types
  - Temporal analysis showing how threats evolve over time
  - Country-by-country threat exposure and impact

- **`Global_Cybersecurity_Threats.xlsx`**  
  A spreadsheet containing raw data on cyber attacks, including attributes such as country, year, attack type, and incident counts.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Descriptive Data Analysis**  
  Summarizes cyber threat data using statistical measures to understand frequency, distribution, and anomalies.

- 🌍 **Global Perspective**  
  Maps and charts display which regions are most affected and how threat levels vary globally.

- 📈 **Trend Analysis**  
  Uses line plots and time series visuals to reveal how cyber threats have changed from year to year.

- 🔍 **Attack Type Breakdown**  
  Categorizes threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware, DDoS) to show which types are most common or increasing.

- 📌 **Visual Storytelling**  
  Engaging charts made with Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to turn data into narratives suitable for reports and presentations.
